This is a Node.js CLI webcrawler tool. 

usage: `npm run start your-url`

`your-url` is the base url in which you want to crawl for all the internal links. 

This will return a report to the terminal window in descending order of how many internal links the baseURL has after recursively crawling through all internal links.
